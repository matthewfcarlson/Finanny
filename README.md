# finanny

Finanny is a future budgeting, forecasting platform.
I have grand plans, but little time.

It's not ready yet but I fully intend to come back to this someday.

## Goals 
- Families can share expenses. Accounts are per household, not per email.
- Show what people in your area are spending on various categories to explain if you are over or under (while maintaining user privacy)
- Budgets can be variable lengths of time (month, week, year, decade)
- Projected income and forecasting allows you to figure out if you want to buy a car by x, what do you need to do
- Reciept scanning? (Nice for tax purposes)
- Have events in addition to budgets (keep track of how much you've spent on your trip to hawaii for example)

## Have an idea?

Drop me a line or open a github issue.
I'd love to hear from you.
